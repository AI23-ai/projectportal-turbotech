## Company Origin Story

### The Name "Togal"
**[00:56]** *"Togal - the full word means builder in the Irish language Gaelic"*

- Named in Irish Gaelic
- Reflects founder's heritage and construction industry roots
- Positioning: Built BY builders FOR builders

### Birth from Coastal Construction
**[01:01-01:10]**
> "It's a spin out of Coastal Construction, our family business. We've been blessed to become one of the largest contractors in Florida"

**Key Facts:**
- Family-owned business
- One of largest contractors in Florida
- Togal originally built for internal use only
- Spun out after proving value internally

### The Problem That Sparked Togal
**[01:09-01:19]**
> "Biggest piece of overhead in our company is estimating, biggest piece of that is takeoffs... takeoffs take a lot of time, it's a manual process clicking and dragging and basically coloring"

**Problem Breakdown:**
1. **Estimating = #1 overhead cost** for Coastal Construction
2. **Takeoffs = biggest piece** of estimating cost
3. **Manual clicking/dragging/coloring** = time-consuming waste
4. **Better use of estimator time:** Value engineering, scoping, bid leveling

### The Build-Then-Spin Journey
**[01:41-01:50]**
> "Originally built Togal to really just be used for Coastal, save us money. As we started seeing it working, we decided to spin it out"

**Progression:**
1. Internal tool to reduce Coastal's overhead
2. Validated savings and efficiency gains
3. Decision to commercialize
4. Full market entry

**Current Status:** [01:47-01:52]
- **700+ users**
- "Some big companies, some small companies, everything in the middle"
- Fully in the market

---

## The Core Value Proposition

### What Togal Automates
**[01:22-01:41]**
> "We had the idea to use artificial intelligence to automate that coloring aspect of it and believe that estimators are better suited spending their time on value engineering, scoping, bid leveling... all the tasks that really help make a bid better and win more work"

**AI Automation Target:**
- **Automates:** The "coloring" - clicking, dragging, counting
- **Frees up estimators for:**
  - Value engineering
  - Scoping
  - Bid leveling
  - Strategic work that wins bids

### Proven ROI: The Coastal Case Study
**[02:03-02:12]**
> "Had a couple companies do some case studies. Coastal did one of those last year and found that they saved almost a million dollars in their first year using Togal straight to the bottom line"

**ROI Metrics:**
- **$1 million saved** in first year
- **"Straight to the bottom line"** - pure profit impact
- Validated by formal case study
- From a company that built the tool (insider validation)

## Industry Insights: Why Preconstruction Hasn't Advanced

### The Inefficiency Crisis
**[02:23-03:11]**
> "How much time do you think is wasted inputting manual data into spreadsheets on a regular basis? A LOT."

**Patrick's Inefficiency Analysis:**

**Repetition Problem:**
- Preconstruction is **not a one-time thing**
- Teams **constantly iterate** throughout pre-con engagement
- **Repeating same processes** over and over with new information
- Using **same manual inefficient tools** each time

**[03:04-03:11]**
> "I think people are running at a 50 to 60% inefficiency rate... one and a half to almost two times the effort to get the one thing done"

**Quantified Waste:**
- **50-60% inefficiency rate** in preconstruction processes
- **1.5-2x the effort** needed vs. what's actually required
- "Incredibly wasteful"

### The Financial Impact
**[03:13-03:29]**
**For smaller companies:**
- "Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of waste in people hours"

**For bigger companies:**
- "Easily millions when you add it all up together"

### The Opportunity Cost
**[03:29-03:52]**
> "It's not just the cost, it's the opportunity loss that's almost incalculable because all of those people hours doing that wasteful thing could have been using that for the thought work and the relationship work or just having more bandwidth to take on other projects"

**What's Lost:**
1. **Thought work** - strategic thinking, problem-solving
2. **Relationship work** - client engagement, partnerships
3. **More bandwidth** - ability to pursue more projects
4. **Upside for companies** - growth potential lost

**Patrick's Assessment:** "Almost incalculable"

---

## Why Technology Hasn't Solved This (Patrick's Theory)

### The Insider vs. Outsider Problem
**[04:14-04:29]**
> "A lot of the technology that we've seen in the industry hasn't come from insiders, it's come from outsiders. Unless you're an insider like us, you don't really understand some of the real issues with precon"

**Patrick's Theory:**
1. **Most construction tech built by outsiders**
2. **Outsiders don't understand:**
   - Real issues with precon
   - Level of detail required
   - The nuance and art involved
   - The specific inefficiencies

**[04:42-04:44]**
> "Then the inefficiency that goes into it... the Nuance, the art that goes into it"

---

### The Duplicated Work Problem
**[04:44-05:01]**
> "On any given job there's a hundred people doing the exact same thing easily... with all the different trades and contractors doing the exact same takeoffs. It's crazy how much repeated work there is"

**Systemic Waste:**
- **100+ people** doing identical takeoffs per job
- Every trade doing their own takeoff of same plans
- "Crazy how much repeated work"
- "With the tools available, that's the only way to do it"

---

### Industry Structural Issues
**[05:04-05:28]**
> "Construction being thin margins, people not having the mindset or capabilities to invest in the technology needed... having outsiders trying to solve problems that maybe weren't even problems, maybe focusing on the wrong things, maybe there's a sexy problem but maybe it's not really solving something"

**Barriers to Innovation:**
1. **Thin margins** - less capital for R&D
2. **Mindset** - risk-averse culture
3. **Lack of capabilities** - to invest in tech
4. **Outsiders solving wrong problems** - sexy but not useful
5. **Misdirected focus** - not addressing real pain points

**[05:28-05:31]**
> "I think we're finally coming around. I'm excited about companies like yours and mine"

**Optimistic outlook:** Change is happening now with insider-led tech companies

---

## Product Philosophy & Strategy

### Incremental Improvement, Not Revolution
**[08:11-08:21]**
> "Similar to what you're doing, Togal isn't trying to change the whole process. We're just incrementally improving one step of it... we're not trying to predict everything, just one piece of it - simplify it"

**Product Strategy:**
- **Incremental** - one step at a time
- **Focused** - not trying to do everything
- **Simplification** - make one thing dramatically better
- **Adoption-friendly** - don't force users to change entire workflow

**Rationale:**
**[08:06-08:11]**
> "The tech sometimes has a tendency to sort of outpace what could really be adopted"

- Tech can advance faster than industry can adopt
- Better to improve what people already do
- Lower barrier to adoption

---

## Future Vision: AI's Impact on Construction

### The Team Behind the Magic
**[07:48-08:02]**
> "Lucky to have a great team... it's all about that team coming together. Mix of the AI algorithm mathematicians and all that... with the construction, sort of the raw construction coming together. That marriage is where I think it's exciting"

**Secret Sauce:**
- **AI/ML experts** ("algorithm mathematicians")
- **Construction experts** ("raw construction")
- **The marriage** of both domains = breakthrough

---

### Near-Term: Predictive Change Orders
**[09:00-09:28]**
> "One of the things we're working on right now is predictive change orders... basically looking at the data set of all the jobs that have been built and comparing that to future jobs"

**How It Works:**
1. **Analyze** historical data from completed jobs
2. **Compare** to plans for future jobs
3. **Identify** discrepancies that led to change orders
4. **Predict** issues before they reach the field

**[09:12-09:20]**
> "As we all know, once you get to the field there's a lot of change orders that are kind of obvious that should have been caught. The computer can catch that"

**Value Proposition:**
- Catch obvious issues during precon
- Prevent costly field change orders
- Leverage historical data across millions of plans

---

### Long-Term: Generative Construction Documents
**[08:23-08:47]**
> "We've got some big ideas with artificial intelligence... recent releases with ChatGPT and generative AI are going to be transformational for our industry. I think we will all live in a world where generative construction documents are made with some very minor input"

**Bold Vision:**
- **Generative AI** creates construction documents
- **Minimal input** from architects/engineers
- **Automated engineering** - "much of this can be boiled down to math"
- **Leverage existing data** - "there's been enough jobs built"

**[08:43-08:55]**
> "Architects and engineers and a lot of that engineering that goes into it will be automated... there's enough data that's out there, there's been enough jobs built, and much of this can be boiled down to math that it can be automated"

**Timeline:** [08:55] "That's the end goal. How do you get there? There's a long way to go"

---

### The Breakthrough Moment
**[09:28-09:43]**
> "The big breakthrough now is that it's affordable for the computers to do a lot of this manual work and quit reinventing the plane every time you want to fly in it. We don't have to reinvent the wheel, it's been done before - let's use that data to improve the process"

**Key Insight:**
- **Compute is now affordable** for massive analysis
- **Don't reinvent** - leverage what's been built before
- **Data-driven improvement** - learn from millions of past projects
- **Stop repetitive work** - automate what's already been solved

- Instead: "We free estimators for higher-value work"

**Higher-Value Work:**
1. Value engineering
2. Scoping
3. Bid leveling
4. "Tasks that really help make a bid better and win more work"

**Why This Frame is Powerful:**
- Appeals to strategic business outcomes (win more bids)
- Positions AI as enabler, not replacement
- Addresses fear of automation ("AI will take my job")
- Focuses on profit growth, not just cost reduction

---

### 4. The 50-60% Inefficiency Opportunity

**Patrick's Quantification:**
- 50-60% inefficiency rate
- 1.5-2x the effort required
- Hundreds of thousands for small companies
- Millions for large companies

**Implication:**
- Massive TAM (total addressable market)
- Room for multiple solutions (Togal, McCormick, others)
- Buyers will pay for 2x productivity gain
- Not a "nice to have" - real budget impact

---

### 5. Incremental Innovation > Revolutionary Change

**Patrick's Philosophy:**
> "Togal isn't trying to change the whole process. We're just incrementally improving one step of it"

**Why This Works:**
- **Lower adoption barrier** - fits existing workflows
- **Less change management** - faster deployment
- **Proves value quickly** - see ROI immediately on one step
- **Room for expansion** - land and expand strategy

**Contrast:**
- Platforms trying to replace entire workflow = high friction
- Single-purpose AI tool = fast adoption, fast value

---

### 6. The Data Moat Strategy

**Current:** 700+ users generating takeoff data

**Near-Term:** Predictive change orders
- Analyze millions of historical plans
- Compare to future projects
- Predict field issues during precon

**Long-Term:** Generative construction documents
- Minimal architect/engineer input
- AI creates complete construction docs
- "Quit reinventing the plane every time"

**The Flywheel:**
1. More users → More data
2. More data → Better AI predictions
3. Better predictions → More value
4. More value → More users
5. Repeat

**Competitive Advantage:**
- First-mover advantage in data collection

---

### 7. The "Hundred People" Problem

**Patrick's Observation:**
> "On any given job there's a hundred people doing the exact same thing easily... with all the different trades and contractors doing the exact same takeoffs"

**Implications:**

**For Togal:**
- Multi-trade opportunity (not just one specialty)
- Collaboration features = competitive advantage
- Shared takeoffs = network effects

**For Competitors (McCormick, etc.):**
- Trade-specific depth vs. general breadth trade-off
- Could multiple specialists (McCormick electrical, others per trade) beat generalist (Togal)?
- Or does Togal's data advantage across all trades win?

**Open Question:**
- Is takeoff data more valuable within-trade or across-trades?
- McCormick: Deep trade knowledge (assemblies, breakdowns)
- Togal: Broad cross-trade patterns (change order predictions)

---
