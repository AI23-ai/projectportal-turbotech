[00:01] [Music]
[00:06] welcome to built by Builders this is our
[00:08] video series highlighting construction
[00:10] professionals who have started tech
[00:12] companies uh to provide the solutions
[00:15] within our
[00:16] industry uh for the very things that
[00:19] they found as pain points and issues
[00:22] that needed to be solved within our
[00:23] industry and we believe it's that kind
[00:25] of leadership from within that is really
[00:28] what's needed to truly Drive Drive our
[00:30] industry forward so I have today Patrick
[00:32] Murphy the founder and CEO of toggle.
[00:36] and also a leader within the Coastal
[00:39] Construction business in Florida Welcome
[00:41] today Patrick thank you Steve thanks for
[00:43] having me I'd love to talk and hear more
[00:45] about toggle and and how it is different
[00:48] from the traditional tools that project
[00:51] teams are using today to do their
[00:53] estimate work first of all tole the name
[00:56] tole AI the full word means builder in
[00:59] the Irish language gck a little factoid
[01:01] there uh and it's a spin out of Coastal
[01:03] Construction our family business uh
[01:06] we're been blessed to become one of the
[01:07] largest contractors in Florida and
[01:09] biggest piece of overhead in our company
[01:11] is is estimated biggest piece of that is
[01:13] takeoffs and you know as we all know in
[01:15] the industry takeoffs take a lot of time
[01:17] it's a manual process clicking and
[01:19] dragging and basically coloring we had
[01:22] the idea to use artificial intelligence
[01:24] to automate that coloring aspect of it
[01:27] and believe that estimators are are
[01:29] better Suited spending their time on
[01:30] value engineering scoping bid leveling
[01:33] you know all the tasks that really help
[01:35] make a bid better and win more work so
[01:38] uh originally built togle uh to to
[01:41] really just be used for Coastal save us
[01:43] money as we started seeing it working we
[01:45] decided to to spin it out and now we're
[01:47] fully in the market uh we've got over I
[01:50] think 700 users now uh some some big
[01:52] companies some small companies
[01:53] everything in the middle and uh we're
[01:55] automating the takeoff process so uh
[01:58] very excited about that excited about
[01:59] with the future holds and uh had a
[02:01] couple companies do some case studies
[02:03] and um Coastal did one of those last
[02:06] year and found that they saved almost a
[02:08] million dollars in their first year
[02:10] using togle straight to the bottom line
[02:12] so it's driving some real efficiency I
[02:14] know you're keeping busy a lot of fun
[02:16] stuff too and concentric is also in in
[02:18] the precon space like us how much time
[02:21] do you think is is wasted inputting
[02:23] manual data into spreadsheets on a
[02:25] regular basis a
[02:27] lot I mean you know pre Construction in
[02:30] its nature is not a one-time thing right
[02:32] so throughout the the life cycle of that
[02:35] pre-con engagement on one project you'll
[02:38] have your team maybe it's one person
[02:39] maybe it's five it could be a dozen or
[02:42] more but they're constantly iterating so
[02:44] they're doing a lot of the same thing
[02:47] periodically updating with more new and
[02:50] more information so not only are they
[02:52] repeating a lot of the same processes
[02:56] over and over and over but they're doing
[02:58] it with the same manual
[03:00] inefficient tools I think people are
[03:04] running at a 50 to 60% inefficiency rate
[03:07] so it's you know whether it's one and a
[03:09] half to almost two times the effort to
[03:11] get the one thing done that is
[03:13] incredibly wasteful but for the smaller
[03:15] companies that process I mean it's
[03:18] hundreds and like you pointed out it's
[03:19] hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[03:21] dollars of waste in people hours and you
[03:25] know the bigger companies it's it's
[03:27] easily Millions when you add it all up
[03:29] together and it's not just the cost it's
[03:31] the opportunity loss that's almost
[03:34] incalculable because all of those people
[03:36] hours doing that thing that wasteful
[03:38] thing that could have been using that
[03:40] for the thought work and the
[03:41] relationship work or just having more
[03:44] bandwidth to take on other projects and
[03:48] yield more you know upside for their
[03:50] respective companies is you know almost
[03:52] incalculable so Patrick you know
[03:54] building on that why do you think it is
[03:57] that there hasn't been that level of
[03:58] Technology ad advancement in this
[04:01] preconstruction phase that we're both
[04:03] passionate about it's a great question
[04:05] like you said I think it's critical it's
[04:07] addressed it's got to be done right it's
[04:08] the beginning of of all jobs is precon
[04:10] so it's got to be done right and as we
[04:12] know it's it is often one of the biggest
[04:14] cost drivers for reasons why it hasn't
[04:17] you know I think a lot of it has to do
[04:19] with a lot of the the the technology
[04:22] that that we've seen in the industry um
[04:25] hasn't come from insiders it's come from
[04:26] Outsiders and unless you're an Insider
[04:29] like us you don't really understand some
[04:31] of the the real issues with precon and
[04:34] and what it takes to truly do it in the
[04:36] amount of detail that goes into it but
[04:39] the Nuance the art that goes into it but
[04:42] then the inefficiency that goes into it
[04:44] right and how you know On Any Given job
[04:46] you know just from the total standpoint
[04:49] there's a hundred people doing the exact
[04:51] same thing easily on on every job right
[04:53] I have job of any any size right with
[04:56] all the different trades and contractors
[04:58] doing the exact same takeoffs I mean
[04:59] it's crazy how much repeated work there
[05:01] is and sort of wasted time but with the
[05:04] tools available that's the only way to
[05:06] do it so you know I think a lot of it
[05:07] has to do with with just construction
[05:09] being thin margins people not having the
[05:12] the the mindset capabilities to invest
[05:15] in the technology needed and and having
[05:18] Outsiders trying to solve problems that
[05:20] that maybe weren't even problems right
[05:22] maybe focusing on the wrong things and
[05:24] maybe there's a sexy problem but maybe
[05:25] it's not really solving something so uh
[05:28] I think I think um I think we're finally
[05:30] coming around so I'm excited about
[05:31] companies like yours and mine but Steve
[05:33] you know what's your vision for how to
[05:35] how to solve these problems and and and
[05:36] in the pre-con phase for Builders I
[05:38] think first and foremost having the
[05:41] right balance between tools that are
[05:44] super powerful and and saving a lot of
[05:46] time and doing it in a very smart way
[05:48] like toggle at the same time also a from
[05:51] a broader preconstruction perspective
[05:53] having a holistic approach which is
[05:55] really our main focus in that how do you
[05:58] take all of the different functions and
[06:02] workflows that make up this very
[06:05] iterative generally fractured process of
[06:08] preconstruction and bring it all in
[06:10] together and so you know our vision at
[06:12] concentric is to be the platform that
[06:15] unites the process unites the data um
[06:19] and pulls all the people together so
[06:22] that way we can drive for the most
[06:24] affordable sustainable and predictable
[06:27] outcomes for these projects we want to
[06:29] be the one that helps bring it all
[06:32] together whether it's companies and
[06:33] people uh and the right assembly of
[06:36] these tools as well as what we will
[06:39] organically build you know when there
[06:40] isn't anything else out there or on the
[06:43] horizon and if we can build all of that
[06:45] and Stitch it together the power of the
[06:48] data going from one project to the next
[06:51] there's this flywheel effect this
[06:53] positive impact that you're getting
[06:55] better and smarter and the data is your
[06:58] data and it Serv serving you in much
[07:00] more powerful ways will still will
[07:04] really start to become a parent to
[07:06] everybody and I think is going to be a
[07:07] real natural um motivator uh for
[07:11] everybody to really rethink about how
[07:14] they do not how they do preconstruction
[07:16] but the tools the elect to use in order
[07:19] to do preconstruction better and smarter
[07:22] but you know it's um these are fun
[07:24] challenges to solve uh I have my hats
[07:26] off to you guys you guys you guys are
[07:28] winning Awards words you guys I mean you
[07:30] yourself are uh was invited to be part
[07:33] of the White House committees on export
[07:36] and everything related to construction
[07:39] so congratulations on that but you know
[07:41] how do you think the AI element of what
[07:43] toggle is doing is going to change
[07:46] change the industry first of all lucky
[07:48] to have a great team you know just like
[07:49] you it's it's all about that that team
[07:51] and coming together mix of the the AI
[07:54] you know algorithm mathematicians and
[07:57] all that the folks we got doing all that
[07:58] with with the construction right sort of
[08:00] the raw construction coming together
[08:02] that that marriage is where I think it's
[08:04] exciting the tech uh sometimes has a
[08:06] tendency to sort of out outpace what
[08:08] could really be adopted and so I think
[08:11] similar to what you're doing togle isn't
[08:13] trying to change the whole process we're
[08:15] just incrementally improving one step of
[08:17] it right we're not trying to uh predict
[08:19] everything just one piece of it right's
[08:21] simplify it and while we've got some big
[08:23] ideas with artificial intelligence and
[08:25] what the future holds some of the recent
[08:27] releases with chat GP and generative Ai
[08:30] and all are going to be transformational
[08:32] for our industry I think we will all
[08:34] live in a in a world again I don't know
[08:36] how long but where generative
[08:39] construction documents are made with
[08:41] some very minor input uh Architects and
[08:43] engineers and a lot of that engineering
[08:45] that goes into it will be automated
[08:47] right there's enough data that's out
[08:48] there there's been enough jobs built and
[08:50] a much of this is can be boiled down to
[08:53] math that it can be automated now that's
[08:55] the end goal how do you get there
[08:57] there's a long way to go uh one of of
[08:59] the things we're we're working on right
[09:00] now is is predictive change orders you
[09:03] know basically looking at at the data
[09:05] set of all the jobs that have been built
[09:08] and comparing that to Future jobs and as
[09:12] we all know once you get to the field
[09:14] there's a lot of change orders that are
[09:16] kind of obvious that should have been
[09:18] caught the computer can catch that
[09:20] because the computer is smart enough and
[09:22] can now it's affordable to analyze
[09:24] literally millions of previous plans
[09:26] that have been built that are up to code
[09:28] and working and so that's the big you
[09:30] know I think breakthrough now is that
[09:32] it's affordable for the computers to do
[09:34] a lot of this manual work and and quit
[09:36] Reinventing plane every time you want to
[09:38] fly in it right we don't have to
[09:40] reinvent the wheel it's been done before
[09:42] let's use that data to improve the
[09:43] process exciting stuff exciting stuff
[09:46] and it's fun to partner with togle on on
[09:48] on what we're all collectively doing so
[09:51] appreciate you being part of this
[09:52] Patrick and uh thank you for your time
[09:55] doing again we're gonna have to do this
[09:57] again we okay sounds good I appreciate
[09:59] your time thanks Patrick thank you
